export const text1 = " In the previous question, we identified learning to be the factor most correlated with enjoyment. The causal explanation that is most likely is that when someone enjoys a game more, they are more likely to pay attention to what they are doing in the game. More specifically, they are attentive to how their actions affect the outcomes of the game and how that affects their enjoyment. As a result deeper learning takes place and the player gets better over time. An alternative plausible explanation for the observed correlation is that you are more likely to enjoy a game that you are good at. Being able to successfully“complete” a round/level/etc of a game could be the make or break moment of a game’s enjoyment."
